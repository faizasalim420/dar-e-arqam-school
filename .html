    <h3>About our journey</h3>
    <p>The first Dar-e-Arqam School was established in Sargodha in 1991. Then, like minded people gathered and spread the rays of knowledge in a very short time. These schools are progressing and increasing in number tremendously. Right now, The Dar-e-Arqam school is one of the largest growing school systems with more than 300,000 students and more than 700 branches all over Pakistan. This appreciation and recognition by the society is more because of its unique way of imparting modern education with Islamic perspective. Alhamdulillah, many achievements have been made so far in the different areas of curricular and co-curricular activities. The journey towards excellence is on very rapidly and every achievement is a beacon of light and source of inspiration. The practical problems are no doubt there but they don’t come in the way of our enthusiastic, strict and dedicated team of selfless and honest workers. These challenges are like opportunities for us and gives us guidance and tips for future planning.</p>
